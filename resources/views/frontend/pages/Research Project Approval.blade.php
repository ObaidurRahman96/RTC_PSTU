<h1>Research Project Approval</h1>
<br>

PSTURTC takes care of both fundamental and applied research programmes in various fields of agricultural and technology sciences. The research project proposal initiated by the teachers of PSTU either individually or jointly is reviewed by the competent reviewer selected generally from amongst the university teachers. After scrutinizing the research projects, selected research proposals are evaluated by the faculty wise technical project evaluation committee. The project evaluation committee consists of the Dean of the faculty, one member from RAC and one member selected by the director of PSTURTC from out of faculty.  The research proposal is modified as per evaluation committee suggestions (if any). The final form of the project proposal is placed in the Research Advisory Committee (RAC) meeting where the project proposal is discussed in details. RAC approves the proposed project after making necessary modifications. Generally, project approval is given for a period of 1-2 years depending on the nature of research and based on application.
